Hi friends, it's hudy again

Recently, i wrote a tutorial about how to build a notebook - desktop application - using Tauri. But, maybe it's not showing up the power of Tauri. Due to that i decided to build another app - a simple code editor (a very basic version like VScode)

This app has some basic functions such as:

- reading files and folders that contains in a directory
- creating new file
- editing file content
- multiple tabs
- showing folder structure
- file icons
